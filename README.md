# Facial Expression Recognition (FER2013) - Deep Learning Project

This project is a Facial Expression Recognition (FER) model trained on the FER2013 dataset. It was developed as part of the **AI and Data Science Scholarship** from **Orange Digital Center** in collaboration with **Amit Learning**.

The model classifies facial expressions into 7 categories using a CNN-based architecture enhanced by the pre-trained **VGG16** network.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The model uses the following pipeline:

- Input: 48x48 grayscale facial image
- Convert grayscale to RGB using 1x1 convolution
- Pass to pre-trained **VGG16** (excluding top layers)
- Global Average Pooling to reduce dimensionality
- Dense layers with Batch Normalization and Dropout for generalization
- Output: Softmax over 7 emotion classes
